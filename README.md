# Introduction to Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

This repo accompanies the *Introduction to Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing* workshop to explain the core concepts of deep learning with emphasis on classifying text as the application. `Python` data stack is used for the workshop. 
 
## Overview

The following topics are covered

1. What is deep learning?
2. Motivation: Some use cases 
3. Building blocks of Neural Networks (Neuron, Activation Function, Backpropagation Algorithm)
4. Word Embedding
5. `word2vec`
5. Introduction to `keras`
6. Multi-layer perceptron
7. Convolutional Neural Network
8. Recurrent Neural Network
9. Challenges in Deep Learning

Depending on time, the following topics might be covered

1. Using `tensorflow` as backend for `keras`
2. Unsupervised learning using Autoencoders

 
## Installation Instructions

Please refer to the [installation](installation.md) instructions document. That document also has instructions on how to run a script to check if the required packages are installed.
