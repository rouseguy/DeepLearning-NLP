# Installation

## Pre-requisites
* Laptop running Linux / OSX / Windows operating system

## Recommended Installation
We will be using Python 3.8 version for the exercise. Users should install the Anaconda distribution from Continuum - [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Please note that installing Anaconda is the **recommended** option for the workshop.

## Post Anaconda Installation

### Switch to the Virtual Environment

    $ source bin/activate

### Install all Requirements

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install single requirements

**`keras`**

Please install `keras` using the following command

    $ pip install keras

**`tensorflow`**

Please install `tensorflow` using the instructions given [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html)

Please note that installing `tensorflow` on Windows is not straight forward. Attendees running Windows will be using `theano` as the back-end for `keras`. `theano` comes with Anaconda.
